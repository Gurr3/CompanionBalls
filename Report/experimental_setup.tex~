Our project setup consisted of a team of three members, a desktop computer and 2 portable laptops. We had 2 Sphero balls to our disposal, they were connected by a bluetooth device to the available computers. A GIT repository in \textt{github.com} was used as version controll for the Java code that controlled the ball.
