Going into this work with the Sphero balls, the team were very unsure of what the balls could do and what was reasonable to do in our timeframe. Therefore, in the start of the project the first priority was to gather information about Spheros to get an understanding about what was needed to reach our goal. By default the APIs provided by the manufacturer only supported mobile applications but as it turned out, a fellow student at LTU had been developing an API for desktop\cite{nicklasgavelin} that we used. One initial thought before we started gathering the information was that one ball should mimic the other. We could soon determine that it would be impossible in our timespan to achieve. Instead we decided on to get the API up and running on a desktop and that we would use one ball, to control the other. In this paper we will go over how we got there. Firstly well go over some basic concepts, the setup and then the results and conclusion.\bigskip
