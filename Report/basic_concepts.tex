A Sphero ball is controlled with information sent over bluetooth from another device, usually a mobile phone. In our case we used a desktop computer that had a portable bluetooth device connected to it. With a third party API\ref{nicklasgavelin} we sent so called “Commands” to the device, we will call them Commands in the future when we refer to them. The API is limited in such way that only predefined commands could be sent and with no time to get into the underlying structure we made do with what we had. So we could make the ball roll, change color of it’s LED, spin and send sensor data from the ball. The ball has both a gyro and accelerometer sensor, of which we made use of the gyro to determine how much the ball is leaning and in which direction.

Knowing we could make the ball move, and pulling data from the ball we got to work with making the desired product.
